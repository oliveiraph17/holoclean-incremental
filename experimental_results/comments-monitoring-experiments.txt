PRECISION X RECALL X F1

HOSPITAL
--------

- Estabilization batch (dk, incremental)
All attributes: 6 (nice convergence, achieving 0.85+ F1 from this batch onwards, which shows the dataset order favors the model)
1 HospitalName, City, PhoneNumber, Sample (zero precision forever)
2 ProviderNumber, HospitalType
3 CountyName, EmergencyService (with zero precision before 3)
4 ZipCode
5 State (huge oscilation before it)
6 HospitalOwner (nice convergence), Stateavg (nice convergence)
9 Condition (4 reaches 100%, then it gets worse for 5 and 6, then gets 100% in 7 and then worses again in 8, and finally 100% by 9)
12 MeasureCode (improves up to 6, keeps stable in 7 and 8, then worses from 9 to 11, and stabilizes in 12)
13 Address1, MeasureName
20 Score (it achieves top quality in batch 7, but then oscilates and stabilizes at a lower quality in 20)

- Estabilization batch (all, incremental)
It seems to be all identical to dk (I checked for all attributes, Condition, and MeasureCode, and for them it was exactly the same behavior)

- Estabilization batch (dk, global)
All attributes: 7 (more visible improvements up to 5, then minor in 7; convergence similar to incremental in general but with slightly higher F1)
2 Condition
3 HospitalOwner
3 MeasureCode (with almost 100% of F1), Address1
32 Score (peak performance in 8 and then minor variations)

- Estabilization batch (all, global)
All attributes: 3
For the other verified attributes, the behavior was the same as dk

HOSPITAL_SHUFFLED
- Estabilization batch (dk, incremental)
All attributes: 3 (very well-behaved curves, but the recall steadily increasing from 0.2 to 0.8 until the last batch, which shows the power of global features)

- Estabilization batch (dk, global)
All attributes: 3 (very well-behaved curves, but achieving 0.9+ F1 from batch 6 onwards -- being trained up to 3)

Errors:
address 	20
city 	18
dbaname 	1
facilitytype 	250
zip 	4


- Estabilization batch (dk, incremental)
All attributes: 5 (nice convergence; F1 almost constant even though the features are incremental)
1 inspectiontype, zip (very bad quality; it drops quicly to a little more than 0.2)
2 address
3 city (reaches 100% F1 as opposed to city with global features!)
6 facilitytype (very stable; curiously, it reaches the best performance in batch 1)
inspectiondate, license, results, risk, inpectiontype, state ==> zero precision

- Estabilization batch (dk, global)
All attributes: 4 (nice convergence; F1 almost constant, so global features don't affect that much this dataset)
The same behavior of incremental for the attributes
city ==> improves up to 9 (100% F1), then deteriorates the recall (and so F1) and stabilizes this way

- Estabilization batch (all, incremental)
All attributes: 9 (very nice convergence, with recall and precision curves crossing)
all and dk performed very close in this dataset

- Estabilization batch (all, global)
All attributes: 9 (very nice convergence, similar to dk --with recall and precision curves crossing-- but even more constant F1)

FOOK5K_SHUFFLED
---------------

- for all/incremental/all_attributes, the precision starts worse than the non-shuffled version, but it stabilizes by batch 12 to a similar same precision
- for dk/incremental/all_attributes, it stabilizes in the first batch!
- for all/global/all_attributes, it stabilizes in batch 7 (very stable)
- for dk/global/all_attributes, it also stabilizes in the first batch!
